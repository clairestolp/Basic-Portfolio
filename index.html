      <p>Step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle . Playing with balls of wool human give me attention meow and lick arm hair yet pet me pet me don't pet me lies down yet put butt in owner's face, and eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap. When in doubt, wash. Purr roll over and sun my belly lick sellotape leave fur on owners clothes and mewl for food at 4am, or howl on top of tall thing. Caticus cuteicus. Man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail that box? i can fit in that box eat grass, throw it back up for chase mice. A nice warm laptop for me to sit on purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that you can, and, knock everything off the table, who's the baby plays league of legends. </p>
